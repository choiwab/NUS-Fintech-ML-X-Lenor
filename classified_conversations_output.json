        "actual conversation": "AI tutor: So, how do you usually like to learn new financial concepts? Do you prefer reading, watching videos, or maybe working on practical exercises? Student: Honestly, I'm a visual learner. I find it easier to understand when I can see charts and graphs. But I also like to take notes and review them later. AI tutor: That's great! Visual aids can be really helpful. We can definitely incorporate more graphics and diagrams into our lessons. And taking notes is a great way to reinforce your understanding. Do you have a preferred way of organizing your notes, or do you like to use digital tools? Student: I usually use a combination of both. I take notes by hand, but then I also scan them and save them digitally. It helps me to review them more easily.",

Student: Honestly, I'm a visual learner. I find it easier to understand when I can see charts and graphs. But I also like to take notes and review them later. AI tutor: That's great! Visual aids can be really helpful. We can definitely incorporate more graphics and diagrams into our lessons. And taking notes is a great way to reinforce your understanding. Do you have a preferred way of organizing your notes, or do you like to use digital tools? Student: I usually use a combination of both. I take notes by hand, but then I also scan them and save them digitally. It helps me to review them more easily.",
